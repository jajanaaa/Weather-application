### Overview

This is my portfolio project - Weather App. The purpose of this project was to practice making API calls. A user is able to search a city or locate themselves and see the current weather at that city or at the current location. A user can see a current date, forecast for the next 5 days, wind status, humidity, visibility, and air pressure. It's also possible to convert the degrees to Fahrenheit. The page is fully responsive for different screen sizes.
